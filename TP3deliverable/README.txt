This project aims to create a virtual robot/assistant whom a user can interact with. The user can use the ‘calendar’ option to build and store their yearly schedule. The robot will also assist the user( if needed) to help figure out where items in their schedule can go, and later help them optimize it. The chatting option allows users to ask the robot questions about restaurants, weather etc) .. In case the user asks specific questions, the robot shall provide links to relevant information.
* My project uses text files to store data about a person’s schedule(12 text files, named by month). It also contains a text file which contains sentences with POS(part of speech) tagging to train the bot. The files are included in the zip.
* Already installed
* Sample data for schedule has been provided( for the month of January). Training data for general questions is also available in the zip.
